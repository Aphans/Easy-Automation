# Easy-Automation

# Description

The project is a home automation system that uses sensors and actuators to control various rooms in the house. The sensors are placed in different areas of the house to detect changes in temperature, humidity, light levels, and motion. The data from the sensors is then analyzed by the system, which triggers appropriate actions through the actuators.

For example, if a sensor in the living room detects that the temperature is too high, the system will turn on the air conditioning unit through the actuator. Similarly, if a sensor in the bedroom detects that the room is too dark, the system will turn on the lights through the actuator.

The system can be programmed to automate different scenarios, such as turning off all lights and appliances when nobody is home, or adjusting the temperature in each room according to the time of day. The system can also be controlled through a mobile app, allowing users to monitor and adjust settings remotely.

Overall, the project aims to provide an efficient and convenient way to manage various aspects of home automation, making daily life more comfortable and energy-efficient.
